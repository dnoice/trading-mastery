This is not just a trading education system. This is a promise to my brother Nick, who's living in a 6-person shared house in Palo Alto because he can't afford his own place despite working his ass off as a welder. This ecosystem represents 16-20 months of disciplined work to build the skills and capital needed to provide help when he needs it.
