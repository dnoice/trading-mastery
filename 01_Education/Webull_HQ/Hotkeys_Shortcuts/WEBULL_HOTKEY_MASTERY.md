## üö® HOTKEY SAFETY PROTOCOLS

### Mistake Prevention

**Double-Press Protection:**
- Enable confirmation on large orders
- Set maximum position size limits
- Use staged entry sizes
- Practice emergency stops regularly

**Fat Finger Prevention:**
```
Problem: Accidentally hit F7 (1000 shares) instead of F1 (100 shares)
Solution: Map dangerous functions to harder-to-hit combos
Example: Move F7/F8 to CTRL+SHIFT+F7/F8
```

**Directional Confusion:**
```
Problem: Hit F1 (buy) when you meant F2 (sell)
Solution: Practice opposite direction emergency
Drill: F1 ‚Üí realize mistake ‚Üí F2 + F2 (net short)
```

### Error Recovery Protocols

**Wrong Size Order:**
```
1. Immediately assess position
2. If too large: Partial close with F9/F10
3. If too small: Add with appropriate F-key
4. Adjust stops accordingly
5. Document for learning
```

**Wrong Direction Order:**
```
1. Flatten immediately with DELETE
2. Re-enter correct direction if setup still valid
3. Accept small loss as education cost
4. Practice prevention drills
```
