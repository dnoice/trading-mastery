## Drill 2: Context Recognition

### Objective

Learn to evaluate pattern significance based on location.

### Method

For each pattern found, rate significance (1-5):

**Rating Scale:**

- 5: Perfect setup (at major S/R, high volume, trend alignment)
- 4: Very good (meets most criteria)
- 3: Average (some context factors)
- 2: Poor (little context support)
- 1: Ignore (no context relevance)

### Practice Routine

1. Find 10 hammer patterns
2. Rate each for trading significance
3. Explain reasoning for each rating
4. Focus on 4-5 rated patterns only
