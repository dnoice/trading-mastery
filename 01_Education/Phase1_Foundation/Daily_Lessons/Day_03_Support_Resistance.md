# DAY 3: SUPPORT & RESISTANCE - KEY LEVELS

## Learning Objectives

- Define support and resistance conceptually and practically
- Identify key levels on charts
- Understand why these levels work
- Learn to trade bounces and breakouts
- Master the psychology behind S&R levels

## What Are Support and Resistance?

### Support

**Definition**: A price level where buying interest is strong enough to overcome selling pressure.

**Think of it as**: A floor that prevents prices from falling further.

**Characteristics:**

- Price bounces UP from this level
- Buying volume often increases
- Previous resistance can become support

### Resistance

**Definition**: A price level where selling pressure is strong enough to overcome buying interest.

**Think of it as**: A ceiling that prevents prices from rising further.

**Characteristics:**

- Price bounces DOWN from this level
- Selling volume often increases
- Previous support can become resistance

## Types of Support and Resistance

### 1. Horizontal Levels

**Most Common and Reliable**

**How to Identify:**

- Look for areas where price has reversed multiple times
- Round numbers (psychological levels): $50, $100, $25.50
- Previous highs and lows
- Opening and closing prices

**Strength Factors:**

- Number of times tested
- Volume at the level
- Time spent at the level
- Recent vs old levels

### 2. Trendlines

**Dynamic Support/Resistance**

**Uptrend Lines** (Support):

- Connect two or more higher lows
- Act as support in uptrends
- Break signals potential trend change

**Downtrend Lines** (Resistance):

- Connect two or more lower highs
- Act as resistance in downtrends
- Break signals potential trend change

### 3. Moving Averages

**Dynamic Levels Based on Price**

**Common MAs:**

- 9 EMA: Short-term trend
- 20 SMA: Intermediate trend
- 50 SMA: Longer-term trend
- 200 SMA: Major trend indicator

**VWAP (Volume Weighted Average Price):**

- Institutional reference point
- Strong intraday support/resistance
- Resets daily

### 4. Fibonacci Levels

**Mathematical Support/Resistance**

**Key Retracement Levels:**

- 23.6%: Shallow pullback
- 38.2%: Normal pullback
- 50.0%: Halfway point
- 61.8%: Deep pullback (Golden ratio)
- 78.6%: Very deep pullback

## The Psychology Behind S&R

### Why Support Works

1. **Previous Buyers**: Those who bought at this level don't want to lose money
2. **New Buyers**: See this as a "good price" based on history
3. **Short Covering**: Shorts take profits at support
4. **Institutional Interest**: Large players often have orders at key levels

### Why Resistance Works

1. **Previous Sellers**: Those who sold at this level want to sell again
2. **Trapped Longs**: Those who bought higher want to "get out even"
3. **New Shorts**: See this as a good place to short
4. **Profit Taking**: Long-term holders take profits at previous highs

## Identifying Strong Levels

### The 3-Touch Rule

**Most Reliable**: Levels that have been tested 3+ times

- First touch: Establishes the level
- Second touch: Confirms the level
- Third touch: Validates the level

### Volume Confirmation

**High Volume at S&R**:

- Shows institutional interest
- Increases reliability
- Creates stronger levels

**Low Volume at S&R**:

- Less reliable
- May break easily
- Use with caution

### Time Factor

**Recent Levels**: More relevant than old levels
**Fresh Levels**: Untested levels from recent price action
**Old Levels**: Still relevant but less reliable

## Trading Support and Resistance

### Strategy 1: Bounce Plays

**Setup**: Price approaches known support/resistance
**Entry**: On the bounce with confirmation
**Stop**: Beyond the S&R level
**Target**: Previous high/low or next S&R level

**Example Long Setup:**

- Stock at $49.50, support at $49.00
- Wait for bounce with volume
- Enter at $49.25
- Stop at $48.90
- Target $50.50 (previous resistance)

### Strategy 2: Breakout Plays

**Setup**: Price breaks through established S&R
**Entry**: On confirmed break with volume
**Stop**: Back inside the broken level
**Target**: Measured move or next S&R level

**Example Breakout:**

- Resistance at $52.00
- Breaks to $52.15 with volume
- Enter at $52.20
- Stop at $51.85
- Target $53.00+ (measured move)

### Strategy 3: Failed Breakout (Reversal)

**Setup**: Breakout fails, price returns to S&R
**Entry**: On failure confirmation
**Stop**: Beyond the attempted breakout
**Target**: Opposite side of range

## Support Becomes Resistance (And Vice Versa)

### Role Reversal

**Broken Support**: Becomes resistance on retests
**Broken Resistance**: Becomes support on retests

**Why This Happens:**

- Those who sold at support now want to buy back
- Those who didn't sell at resistance now want to sell
- New traders enter at the "new" level

### Trading Role Reversals

**High Probability Setups:**

- Previous support that's now resistance
- Usually get one good bounce before breaking permanently
- Great for short entries

## Drawing Levels on Charts

### Best Practices

1. **Use Wicks and Bodies**: Sometimes wicks, sometimes bodies matter more
2. **Don't Force Levels**: If you have to "make it fit," it's probably not valid
3. **Multiple Timeframes**: Check higher timeframes for major levels
4. **Clean Charts**: Don't draw too many lines - focus on the obvious ones

### Common Mistakes

- **Over-analyzing**: Drawing levels everywhere
- **Ignoring Volume**: Not considering volume at levels
- **Wrong Timeframe**: Using 1-minute levels for swing trades
- **Static Thinking**: Not adjusting as new levels form

## Practical Exercise

**Your Assignment for Tonight:**

1. Pick 3 stocks from today's gap scanner
2. Open daily charts
3. Identify 2-3 key support levels and 2-3 resistance levels
4. Note volume characteristics at each level
5. Set alerts for when price approaches these levels

**Documentation Template:**

```
Stock: AAPL
Support 1: $175.50 (3 touches, high volume)
Support 2: $173.00 (previous resistance, now support)
Resistance 1: $178.25 (recent high, low volume)
Resistance 2: $180.00 (psychological level)
```

## Real Trading Application

### Pre-Market Analysis

1. Identify key levels from yesterday
2. Note overnight levels
3. Mark potential breakout areas
4. Plan both bounce and breakout scenarios

### During Market Hours

1. Watch for reactions at levels
2. Confirm with volume
3. Enter only on clear signals
4. Manage risk at broken levels

## Advanced Concepts Preview

As you progress, you'll learn:

- **Supply and Demand Zones**: Areas vs specific prices
- **Order Flow**: Reading depth and tape
- **Institution Levels**: Where big money operates
- **Confluence**: Multiple levels at same price

## Day 3 Assessment

**Conceptual Questions:**

1. What makes a support level "strong"?
2. Why does previous resistance become support?
3. How does volume affect S&R reliability?
4. What's the difference between horizontal and dynamic S&R?
5. Describe a high-probability bounce setup.

**Practical Exercise:**
Draw support and resistance levels on SPY daily chart for the past month. Identify role reversals.

## The Nick Factor

Think about Nick's work as a welder. He knows exactly where stress points are in metal - where it will bend or break under pressure. These support and resistance levels are the same thing in stocks. They're the stress points where buying and selling decisions are made. Master these levels, and you'll know where the market is most likely to turn - bringing you closer to the skills needed to change Nick's situation.

## Tomorrow's Preview

Day 4: "Volume Analysis - The Truth Behind Moves"
Volume is the fuel that drives price movement. Tomorrow we'll learn to read this critical indicator.

**Tonight's Practice**: Spend 45 minutes drawing S&R levels on different timeframes. The more you practice, the faster you'll spot them in real-time trading.
