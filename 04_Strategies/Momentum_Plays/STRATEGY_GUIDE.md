# MOMENTUM TRADING STRATEGY GUIDE - COMPLETE EDITION

## Executive Summary
Momentum trading capitalizes on the continuation of existing trends, riding strong price movements backed by volume and market participation. Unlike gap trading which focuses on opening moves, momentum trading identifies and exploits sustained directional movements throughout the trading day.

## Core Philosophy
> "The trend is your friend until the end when it bends." - Ed Seykota

Momentum trading is based on Newton's first law applied to markets: Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. We identify stocks already moving strongly and position ourselves to profit from the continuation.

## Risk Management Matrix

### Position Sizing Formula
```python
def calculate_position_size(momentum_score, volatility, account_balance):
    base_risk = 0.01  # 1% base risk
    
    # Adjust for momentum strength
    if momentum_score > 85:
        risk_multiplier = 1.5
    elif momentum_score > 75:
        risk_multiplier = 1.2
    elif momentum_score > 70:
        risk_multiplier = 1.0
    else:
        risk_multiplier = 0.8
    
    # Adjust for volatility (ATR%)
    if volatility > 5:
        vol_multiplier = 0.7
    elif volatility > 3:
        vol_multiplier = 0.9
    else:
        vol_multiplier = 1.1
    
    position_risk = base_risk * risk_multiplier * vol_multiplier
    return account_balance * position_risk
```

### Maximum Exposure Rules
