# GAP AND GO STRATEGY GUIDE

## Overview

The Gap and Go strategy capitalizes on stocks that gap up in pre-market and continue moving higher after the open.

## Setup Criteria (ALL must be met)

1. **Gap Size:** Minimum 4% gap up from previous close
2. **Volume:** Pre-market volume > 500k shares
3. **Price Range:** $5 - $500 (beginners stick to $10-$100)
4. **Float:** Preferably under 100M shares
5. **Catalyst:** Clear news (earnings, FDA, partnership, etc.)
6. **Relative Volume:** > 2x average daily volume

## Entry Rules

### Primary Entry: Break of Pre-Market High

- Wait for first 5-15 minutes to establish range
- Enter on break above pre-market high with volume
- Stop loss: Below the low of the opening range
- Target 1: 1.5x risk (50% position)
- Target 2: 2-3x risk (remaining position)

### Secondary Entry: First Pullback

- After initial push, wait for pullback to VWAP or 9 EMA
- Enter on bounce with volume confirmation
- Stop: Below the pullback low
- Same targets as primary entry

## Risk Management

- **Position Size:** Max 1% account risk per trade
- **Stop Loss:** ALWAYS use hard stops, no mental stops
- **Scaling:** Take 50% profits at Target 1, move stop to breakeven
- **Time Stop:** If no movement in 30 minutes, consider exiting

## Indicators to Use

1. **VWAP:** Key support/resistance
2. **9 EMA:** Short-term trend
3. **Volume:** Must see increasing volume on breakouts
4. **Level 2:** Watch for big sellers at resistance

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Chasing:** Don't enter after big green candles
2. **No Stop Loss:** This will blow up your account
3. **Fighting the Trend:** If it breaks below VWAP, get out
4. **Oversizing:** Gaps can reverse quickly
5. **Holding Too Long:** Take profits into strength

## Example Trade Walkthrough

**Stock:** XYZ
**Gap:** 8% on earnings beat
**Pre-market High:** $25.50
**Opening Range:** $25.00 - $25.30

**Entry:** $25.55 (break of pre-market high)
**Stop:** $24.95 (below opening range)
**Risk:** $0.60 per share
**Target 1:** $26.15 (1:1 risk/reward)
**Target 2:** $26.75 (2:1 risk/reward)

**Position Size Calculation:**

- Account: $5,000
- 1% Risk: $50
- Shares: $50 / $0.60 = 83 shares
- Position Value: 83 � $25.55 = $2,120
